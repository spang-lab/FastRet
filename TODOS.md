# Todos

1. Improve visualization instructions
2. Add visualization of feature importance
3. Add "Use current trained model" checkbox next to "upload trained model"
4. Table rows should not be selectable
5. Implement Fadis doc suggestions
6. Add Fadi as copyright holder
7. Add myself as `contact`
8. Add `How to cite` section
9. Move `toscm/fastret-dev` to the [spang-lab container registry](https://gitlab.spang-lab.de/k8s/ha-config/container_registry)
10. Move `fastret-dev` and `fastret` Kubernetes deployments into HA-Config repo
11. Enable auto-build of `toscm/fastret-base:x.x.x` container
12. Show RT_ADJ ~ RT_ORIG in adjust_model plot
13. Enable rerender on resize
14. Show model coefficients
15. Add question mark with help texts to plots. (RS)
16. Move formulas from legend to help texts and use simple words in legend. (RS)
17. Add unit (minutes) to MSE and MAE. (RS)
18. Show unit in axis labels. (RS)
19. Rename mode "Selective Measuring" to "Design Reference Molecule Panel" (RS)
20. Make "minutes" as RT-unit mandatory. (RS)
21. Press of button "Save predictor set" currently takes multiple seconds. This should be much faster and also run asynchronous, i.e. in an "extended task".
22. Enable auto-build of `toscm/fastret:x.x.x-jdkyy` containers for all major jdk versions
23. Finalize rcdk dependency analysis
24. Offer "quantile normalization" as preprocessing step (RS)
25. Implement "remove not suitable descriptors" (Suggestion from Katja: use data from HMDB for prefiltering)
26. Make plots interactive (hovering over points should show molecule name)
27. Show PCA embedding of new points into training data after prediction
28. Enable auto-build of fastret-dev:x.x.x-jdkyy containers
29. Add a logo to the package
