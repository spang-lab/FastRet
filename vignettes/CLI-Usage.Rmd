FastRet comes with a GUI for easy and intuitive use. However, sometimes it's preferable to use FastRet programmatically. This vignette will show you how to use FastRet from the R command line.

FastRet supports the fitting of two different types of models: regularized linear models (LASSO) and boosted regression trees. To train a LASSO model, you can use the following code:

```R
# TODO
```

To train a boosted regression tree model, you can use:

```R
