To contribute to this package, you should follow the below steps:

1. Create a issue at [github.com/toscm/FastRet/issues](https://github.com/toscm/FastRet/issues) describing the problem or feature you want to work on.
2. Wait until the issue is approved by a package maintainer.
3. Create a fork of the repository at [github.com/toscm/FastRet](https://github.com/toscm/FastRet)
4. Make your edits as described in section [Making Edits](#making-edits)
5. Create a pull request at [github.com/toscm/FastRet/pulls]

## Making Edits

Things you can update, are:

1. Function code in folder [R](R)
2. Function documentation in folder [R](R)
3. Package documentation in folder `vignettes`
4. Test cases in folder [tests](tests)
5. Dependencies in file [DESCRIPTION](DESCRIPTION)
6. Authors in file [DESCRIPTION](DESCRIPTION)

Whenever you update any of those things, you should run the below commands to check that everything is still working as expected

```R
devtools::test() # Execute tests from tests folder
devtools::check() # Check package formalities
devtools::document() # Build files in man folder
devtools::install() # Install as required by next command
pkgdown::build_site() # Build website in docs folder
```

After doing these steps, you can push your changes to Github and then use the following commands to release the package to CRAN:

```R
rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck() # Slower, but more realistic test than devtools::check()
devtools::spell_check() # Check spelling. Add false positives to inst/WORDLIST
devtools::submit_cran() # Submits the package to CRAN
revdepcheck::revdep_check(num_workers = 8) # Reverse dependency check
# See https://r-pkgs.org/release.html#sec-release-revdep-checks for details
```

Above steps are based on: <https://r-pkgs.org/release.html>
