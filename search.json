Improved progress output. Smiles now pre-cached internally speed retrieval CDs large datasets. Now available exported function (function existed , exposed via Graphical User Interface). Now users can call directly R scripts. Added semi-transparent background legends better readability Changed point character unfilled circles colored borders filled circles black borders better visibility. Constant predictions (causing correlation NA) longer cause warning. Added argument add_cds control whether chemical descriptors added input data using getCDs(). Added argument rm_ucs control whether unsupported columns (.e. columns neither mandatory optional) removed input data. Added argument rt_terms control whether transformations RT column (square, cube, log, exp, sqrt) added input data. case missing mandatory columns (SMILES, RT, NAME) error now raised. INCHIKEY Chemical Descriptors listed CDFeatures allowed optional columns. Columns neither mandatory optional automatically removed. Improved runtime generation polynomial features /interaction terms. Removal NA /near-zero-variance predictors now done adding polynomial features /interaction terms. Improved progress output. Added argument do_cv control whether cross-validation performed performance estimation. Default TRUE. Removal near-zero-variance predictors /removal NA values now done part internal model training, .e. happens separately fold cross-validation. prevents data leakage training set validation set. corresponding hint “overoptimistic cross-validation results” consequently removed documentation. Argument method now accepts two values training models xgbtree base: “gbtreeDefault” (train xgboost default params) “gbtreeRP” (train xgboost parameters optimized RP dataset). old value “gbtree” still works now alias “gbtreeDefault”. Improved documentation return value (.e. frm objects fully specified now). Added type checking user input. Performance estimation via cross-validation now uses new clipping mechanism provided clip_predictions(). course, clipping always based RT range training folds, whole original training data. Calculating proportion variance explained (R²) longer throws warning constant predictions (causing correlation NA). Instead, R² set 0 cases. Data transformations applied training data (adding polynomial features /adding interaction terms) now automatically applied new data well. case , leading errors trying predict RTs using models trained degree_polynomial>1 /interaction_terms=TRUE, unless transformations manually applied new data beforehand. Added argument clip allow clipping predictions within RT range training data. Works adjusted unadjusted models. Predictions now clipped within sensible range default. produce unclipped predictions, set clip=FALSE. See clip_predictions() details. chemical descriptor NA new data, required model, NA value now replaced mean descriptor training data. Previously, prediction entries NA. old behavior can restored setting impute=FALSE predict.frm(). Added argument rt_coef, allowing user control influence RT clustering. value 0 means RT ignored, value “max_ridge_coefficient” means RT weight important chemical descriptor value 1 means scaling (except standardization z-scores, applied whole dataset ridge regression trained). Added argument seed allow reproducible results. Added argument do_cv control whether cross-validation performed performance estimation. Default TRUE. Added argument adj_type control model trained adjustment: supported options “lm”, “lasso”, “ridge”, “gbtree”. Previously, “lm” supported. stay backwards compatible, default “lm”. Added argument add_cds control whether chemical descriptors added input data using getCDs(). recommended adj_type “lm”. Added support mapping SMILES+INCHIKEY addition SMILES+NAME. SMILES+INCHIKEY used default columns present adjusted original training data. Otherwise SMILES+NAME used . Improved error handling. Previously, unmappable entries new data ignored silently. Now, error raised cases. Function arguments now stored returned frm object better reproducibility. Mapping now performed matching new entry average RT original training entries key (SMILES+INCHIKEY SMILES+NAME). Example: new dataset contains key twice, original training data contains key three times, new entries mapped average RT three original entries. Performance estimation via cross-validation now uses new clipping mechanism provided clip_predictions(). course, clipping always based RT range training folds, whole original training data. Calculating proportion variance explained (R²) longer throws warning constant predictions (causing correlation NA). Instead, R² set 0 cases. frm objects can now printed directly console user-friendly format. New utility function clipping predicted RTs within sensible range. Used internally train_frm(), predict.frm() adjust_frm(). Added arguments base adjust control whether predictors base model, adjustment model returned. Bugfixes: Interaction terms generated preprocess_data() now generated correctly product involved features instead division. follows common practice regression modeling avoids division zero issues. Passing older models, trained division-based interaction terms, downstream functions like predict.frm() adjust_frm() now lead error. (breaking change, predict.frm() friends fact never able handle models). plot_frm() type “scatter.cv.adj” “scatter.train.adj” now correctly shows retention times new data (used model adjustment) x-axis values instead original training retention times. catf() now emits escape codes (.e. colored output), output directed terminal. output redirected file pipe, escape codes emitted anymore. Since catf() used throughout package logging, fixes output whole package. Internal Improvements: adjust_frm() fit_gbtree() fit_glmnet() get_param_grid() get_predictors() getCDs() plot_frm() predict_frm() preprocess_data() selective_measuring() train_frm() validate_inputdata() createFolds() nearZeroVar() Extract mapping merging part adjust_frm() private function merge_dfs(). Replaced fit_glmnet(), fit_lasso() fit_ridge() single function fit_glmnet(), takes method (“lasso” “ridge”) parameter. Instead dataframe df contain predictors plus RT column (reponse), function now takes matrix predictors X vector responses y. makes function flexible easier test. Replaced fit_gbtree_grid() much simpler function find_params_best(). Instead allowing specification every grid parameter, new function instead accepts keyword searchspace specifying predefined grids choose . Improved fit_gbtree exposing lots hardcoded internal xgboost parameters function parameters sensible defaults. particular, user can now set xpar “default”, “rpopt” predefined grid-size train model different hyperparameter settings. Furthermore, function now written way works , version 1.7.9.1 new 3.1.2.1 version published 2025/12/03 (yes, version 2.x skipped completely). Added helper function get_param_grid() returning predefined hyperparameter grids xgboost model training based keywords like “tiny”, “small” “large”. Added function benchmark_find_params() benchmark runtime find_params_best() different numbers cores /threads. turns , choosing higher number cores usually efficient (cost worse progress output).
