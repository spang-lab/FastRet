\title{Train a new FastRet model (FRM) for retention time prediction}
\usage{
train_frm(
  df,
  method = "lasso",
  verbose = 1,
  nfolds = 5,
  nw = 1,
  degree_polynomial = 1,
  interaction_terms = FALSE,
  rm_near_zero_var = TRUE,
  rm_na = TRUE,
  rm_ns = FALSE,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe with columns "NAME", "RT", "SMILES" and optionally a set of
chemical descriptors. If no chemical descriptors are provided, they are
calculated using the function \code{\link[=preprocess_data]{preprocess_data()}}.}

\item{method}{A string representing the prediction algorithm. Either "lasso", "ridge",
"gbtree", "gbtreeDefault" or "gbtreeRP". Method "gbtree" is an alias for
"gbtreeRP".}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether to print progress messages.}

\item{nfolds}{An integer representing the number of folds for cross validation.}

\item{nw}{An integer representing the number of workers for parallel processing.}

\item{degree_polynomial}{An integer representing the degree of the polynomial. Polynomials up to the
specified degree are included in the model.}

\item{interaction_terms}{A logical value indicating whether to include interaction terms in the model.}

\item{rm_near_zero_var}{A logical value indicating whether to remove near zero variance predictors.}

\item{rm_na}{A logical value indicating whether to remove NA values before training.
Highly recommended to avoid issues during model fitting. Setting this to
FALSE with \code{method = "lasso"} will most likely lead to errors.}

\item{rm_ns}{A logical value indicating whether to remove chemical descriptors that were
considered as not suitable for linear regression based on a previous analysis
of an independent dataset. Currently not used.}

\item{seed}{An integer value to set the seed for random number generation to allow for
reproducible results.}
}
\value{
A 'FastRet Model', i.e., an object of class \code{frm}. Components are:
\itemize{
\item \code{model}: The fitted base model. This can be an object of class \code{glmnet}
(for Lasso or Ridge regression) or \code{xgb.Booster} (for GBTree models).
\item \code{df}: The data frame used for training the model. The data frame contains
all user-provided columns (including mandatory columns RT, SMILES and NAME)
as well the calculated chemical descriptors. (But no interaction terms or
polynomial features, as these can be recreated within a few milliseconds).
\item \code{cv}: A named list containing the cross validation results. Elements are:
\itemize{
\item \code{folds}: A list of integer vectors specifying the samples in each fold.
\item \code{models}: A list of models trained on each fold.
\item \code{stats}: A list of vectors with RMSE, Rsquared, MAE, pBelow1Min per fold.
\item \code{preds}: Retention time predictions obtained in CV as numeric vector.
}
\item \code{seed}: The seed used for random number generation.
\item \code{version}: The version of the FastRet package used to train the model.
\item \code{args}: The value of function arguments besides \code{df} as named list.
}
}
\description{
Trains a new model from molecule SMILES to predict retention times (RT) using
the specified method.
}
\examples{
m <- train_frm(df = RP[1:40, ], method = "lasso", nfolds = 2, verbose = 0)
# For the sake of a short runtime, only the first 40 rows of the RP dataset
# are used in this example. In practice, you should always use the entire
# training dataset for model training.
