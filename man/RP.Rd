\title{Retention Times (RT) Measured on a Reverse Phase (RP) Column}
\format{
A dataframe of 442 metabolites with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{RT}{Retention time}
\item{SMILES}{SMILES notation of the metabolite}
\item{NAME}{Name of the metabolite}
}
}
\source{
Measured by functional genomics lab at the University of Regensburg.
}
\usage{
RP
}
\description{
Retention time data from a reverse phase liquid chromatography measured with a temperature of 35 degree and a flowrate of 0.3ml/min. The same data is available as an xlsx file in the package. To read it into R use \code{read_rp_xlsx()}.
