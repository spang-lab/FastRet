- [x] Use async buttons for long running tasks
- [x] Make sure adjusted models are used for prediction, when available
- [x] Remove boxplots (RS)
- [x] Hide sections `Method`, `Preprocessing Options` and `Seed` behind `Show advanved Settings` button (RS)
- [x] Label "XGboost" as "XGBoost (recommended)" (RS)

- [ ] Show RT_ADJ ~ RT_ORIG in adjust_model plot
- [ ] Show model coefficients
- [ ] Fix Download of trained dataset
- [ ] Fix missing j in "adusted"
- [ ] Finalize rcdk dependency analysis
- [ ] Merge into main
- [ ] Nach github/spang-lab umziehen
- [ ] Finalize docs
- [ ] Add question mark with help texts to plots. (RS)
- [ ] Move formulas from legend to help texts and use simple words in legend. (RS)
- [ ] Add unit (minutes) to MSE and MAE. (RS)
- [ ] Make "minutes" as RT-unit mandatory. (RS)
- [ ] Show unit in axis labels. (RS)
- [ ] Rename mode "Selective Measuring" to "Design Reference Molecule Panel" (RS)

- [ ] LATER: Offer "quantile normalization" as preprocessing step (RS)
- [ ] LATER: Implement RAM caching for `getCD`
- [ ] LATER: Move cache to `pvc`
- [ ] LATER: Implement "remove not suitable descriptors" (Suggestion from Katja: use data from HMDB for prefiltering)
- [ ] LATER: Make plots interactive (hovering over points should show molecule name)
- [ ] LATER: Show PCA embedding of new points into training data after prediction
