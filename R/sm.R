#' @title Selective Measuring
#' @description The function [adjust_frm()] is used to modify existing FastRet models based on changes in chromatographic conditions. It requires a set of molecules with measured retention times on both the original and new column. This function selects a sensible subset of molecules from the original dataset for re-measurement. The selection process includes:
#' 1. Generating chemical descriptors from the SMILES strings of the molecules. These are the features used by [train_frm()] and [adjust_frm()].
#' 2. Standardizing chemical descriptors to have zero mean and unit variance.
#' 3. Training a Ridge Regression model with the standardized chemical descriptors as features and the retention times as the target variable.
#' 4. Scaling the chemical descriptors by coefficients of the Ridge Regression model.
#' 5. Applying PAM clustering on the entire dataset, which includes the scaled chemical descriptors and the retention times.
#' 6. Returning the clustering results, which include the cluster assignments, the medoid indicators, and the raw data.
#' @param raw_data The raw data to be processed. Must be a dataframe with columns NAME, RT and SMILES.
#' @param k_cluster The number of clusters for PAM clustering.
#' @param verbose The level of verbosity.
#' @return A list containing the following elements:
#' * `clustering`: a data frame with raw data, cluster assignments, and medoid indicators
#' * `clobj`: the PAM clustering object
#' * `coefs`: the coefficients from the Ridge Regression model
#' * `model`: the Ridge Regression model
#' * `df`: the preprocessed data
#' * `dfz`: the standardized features
#' * `dfzb`: the features scaled by coefficients of the Ridge Regression model
