Description: A framework for liquid chromatography retention time prediction.
    It offers functionalities to train custom models for specific chromatography
    columns, predict retention times using pre-existing models, and adjust
    models to accommodate altered chromatographic conditions. FastRet can be
    accessed via the R console or its intuitive graphical user interface.
